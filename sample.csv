http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11631712,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00000774,Are these two records referring to the indicated trial?,A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant HIV-1 Envelope Antigen in Children Born to HIV-Infected Mothers,"PRIMARY: To determine the safety of envelope recombinant proteins rgp120/HIV-1MN (Genentech) and rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (Chiron/Biocine) in infants who are of indeterminate HIV status born to HIV-infected women. To evaluate changes in viral load in infants proven to be infected and absolute CD4 counts in all immunized infants. SECONDARY: To evaluate the immunogenicity of these envelope recombinant proteins in infants of indeterminate HIV status born to HIV-infected women. Only 30-50 percent of HIV-infected infants have detectable virus at birth. Successful early sensitization to HIV envelope epitopes may help prevent infection or, alternatively, may enhance HIV-specific immune function to alter HIV replication and disease progression.",cb45a93f-e71e-4803-ac95-3a207c24f7bb
